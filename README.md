# React Native FlatList Intermittent Empty List Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component intermittently renders an empty list even when data is successfully fetched from an API. The issue is non-deterministic and can be difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

A `FlatList` component is used to display data fetched from a remote API.  While the data fetching process appears successful (as confirmed by logging the fetched data), the `FlatList` frequently renders an empty list. The problem's intermittent nature makes debugging challenging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application (using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
3. Observe that the FlatList may sometimes show the fetched data and sometimes remain empty, even with consistent API responses.

## Solution

The solution involves using a key function within the `FlatList` component to ensure that the items are uniquely identified when updating the data.
